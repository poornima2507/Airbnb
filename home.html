                Airbnb Revenue of $8.4 billion USDgrew 40 percent year over year. Guest demand remained strong
                throughout 2022. All regions saw a significant growth in 2022 as guests increasingly crossed borders and
                returned to cities on Airbnb. In Q4 2022, Airbnb had their highest number of active bookers yet,
                demonstrating guests’ excitement to travel on Airbnb despite evolving macroeconomic uncertainties.

                As of Q3 2023, around 90% of traffic to Airbnb was direct or unpaid*. Why this is important for you:
                users visiting Airbnb from a search engine have a specific intent, giving you access to incremental
                bookings and a new audience.

                Here are some of the steps we take to offer you peace of mind while you host:
                Airbnb will verify the identity of all guests that book.
                Our proprietary technology analyses hundreds of factors in each reservation and blocks certain bookings
                that show a high risk for disruptive parties and property damage.
                In August 2020, Airbnb first announced a ban on all parties and events in listings globally. The ban has
                proved effective, and in June 2022, Airbnb officially codified the ban as a policy.
